	<h2> Buddhism </h2><br>

	    <p  class="cp1 cp2"> 
       	    	Buddhism is an Indian religion founded on the teachings of a mendicant and spiritual teacher called "the Buddha" ("the Awakened One").
	        Buddha's family name as "Gautama" Siddharta Gautama was born in Lumbini and grew up in Kapilavastu, a town in the Ganges Plain, near the modern Nepalâ€“India border.
	        Legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini(now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh).

	     <p class="p1"><br>		 
		
		Gautama was moved by the suffering of life and death, and its endless repetition due to rebirth.
		He thus set out on a quest to find liberation from suffering (also known as "nirvana").
		Gautama first studied under two teachers of meditation, namely Alara Kalama (Sanskrit: Arada Kalama) and Uddaka Ramaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Ramaputra), 
		learning meditation and philosophy, particularly the meditative attainment of "the sphere of nothingness", and "the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception".
		Then he turned to the practice of severe asceticism, which included a strict fasting regime and various forms of breath control.
		And, then he turned to the meditative practice of dhyana. 
		He famously sat in meditation under a Ficus religiosa tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya and attained "Awakening"(Bodhi). 
		As a fully enlightened Buddha, he attracted followers and founded a Sangha (monastic order).
		Lastly, he spent the rest of his life teaching the Dharma he had discovered, 
		and then died, achieving "final nirvana," at the age of 80 in Kushinagar, India.

		Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers, or over 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists.
		Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies.
		The two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: "The School of the Elders") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: "The Great Vehicle").
